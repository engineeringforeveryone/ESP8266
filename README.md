# ESP8266 Projects
This repository contains a collection of small ESP8266 projects showcased on my [instagram page](https://instagram.com/engineeringforeveryone).

Feel free to drop me a message here or on instagram if you have any questions.


# Buzzer
The buzzer project contains a series of functions that showcase micropython's built-in pwm control to create with a buzzer.

# RFID
This project is a simple access control system that rejects or accepts a detected card based on its unique identifier (uid). 
If a card is accepted, a buzzer plays a certain sound pattern. If a card is rejected, a different sound is played back.

Note: this project incorporates the following rfid library: https://github.com/wendlers/micropython-mfrc522 . 
I base part of my code off the *examples/read.py* source code.
